**Moe Memos** is an app to help you capture thoughts and ideas.

You can use Moe Memos with either a self-hosted [✍️memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) server or locally on your device (no server required).

**Note: Current Moe Memos version supports Memos 0.21.0, 0.26.0, and 0.26.1. Memos update may introduce breaking API changes. If you are using a version higher than 0.26.1, it is recommended to use [Mortis](https://github.com/mudkipme/mortis) to convert the newer Memos API to the Memos 0.21.0 API and re-login in Moe Memos.**
