## What's Changed
- Added support for Memos 0.25.0. Due to breaking API changes, Memos versions 0.22.0â€“0.24.x are no longer supported. You can continue using Memos 0.21.0 or upgrade to 0.25.0.

Note: Future Memos versions may introduce breaking API changes again. If you are using a version higher than 0.25.0, it is recommended to use [Mortis](https://github.com/mudkipme/mortis) to convert the newer Memos API to the Memos 0.21.0 API and re-login in Moe Memos.
